Your First Weekend Project!
===========================

###It's like a hackathon without all the terrible smells.

Congratulations, you've made it two weeks! It's been lots of drills and tough challenges but the first little payoff is finally here - the first time you build something and bring an idea to life.

Work together, challenge each other and play to your strengths. And don't forget the old saying, "use Git correctly or you're gonna have a bad time."

Inside this folder you'll find a skeleton for your project. 

-model.py module that holds the model functions - interacts with your database and parses information you get from the db. This should also have functions that do the heavy lifting on your program logic. 

-controller.py is a class that you initialize. It acts as the intermediary between your models and views.

-views.py holds all the functions that print output to the user and take input from the user.

There is a very simple working example inside this skeleton. Understand how it works so you can take advantage of its structure, as well as copy paste some sqlite boilerplate. We expect skinny controllers, fat models, and all display logic to be in the view functions.

Have fun and make something awesome!!
